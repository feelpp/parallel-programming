= Hybrid MPI and OpenMP

== MPI, OpenMP two complementary parallelization models.
[.text-justify]
* MPI is a multi-process model whose mode of communication between the processes is *explicit* (communication management is the responsibility of the user). MPI is generally used on multiprocessor machines with distributed memory. MPI is a library for passing messages between processes without sharing.
[.text-justify]
* OpenMP is a multitasking model whose mode of communication between tasks is *implicit* (the management of communications is the responsibility of the compiler). OpenMP is used on shared-memory multiprocessor machines. It focuses on shared memory paradigms. It is a language extension for expressing data-parallel operations (usually parallelized arrays over loops).
[.text-justify]
Note: on a cluster of independent shared-memory multiprocessor machines (nodes), the implementation of a two-level parallelization (MPI, OpenMP) in the same program can be a major advantage for the parallel performance of the code.

Hybrid application programs using MPI + OpenMP are now commonplace on large HPC systems. There are basically two main motivations for this combination of programming models:
[.text-justify]
{empty}1. Reduced memory footprint, both in the application and in the MPI library (eg communication buffers).
[.text-justify]
{empty}2. Improved performance, especially at high core counts where pure MPI scalability runs out.

* From dequential code, alongside MPI first, then try adding OpenMP
* From MPI code, add OpenMP
* From OpenMP code, treat as serial code
* The simplest and least error-prone method is to use MPI outside the parallel region and allow only the master thread to communicate between MPI tasks.
* Could use MPI in parallel region with thread-safe MPI.
