= OpenMP (Open Multi-Processing)

OpenMP ( Open Multi-Processing ) is a programming interface for parallel
computing on shared memory architecture.

It allows you to manage:

* {blank}
+

the creation of light processes,

* {blank}
+

the sharing of work between these lightweight processes,

* {blank}
+

synchronizations (explicit or implicit) between all light processes,

* {blank}
+

the status of the variables (private or shared).

*General concepts*

An OpenMP program is executed by a single process.

* This process activates lightweight processes (threads) at the entrance
to a parallel region. +
* Each thread performs a task consisting of a set of instructions. +
* During the execution of a task, a variable can be read and/or modified
in memory.


– It can be defined in the stack (local memory space) of a lightweight
process; we then speak of a private variable

– It can be defined in a shared memory space


* An OpenMP program is an alternation of sequential regions and parallel
regions. +
* A sequential region is always executed by the master task, the one
whose rank is 0. +
* A parallel region can be executed by several tasks at the same time. +
* The tasks can share the work contained in the parallel region.

* Work sharing essentially consists of:


– execute a loop by distributing the iterations between the tasks; +
– execute several sections of code but only one per task; +
– execute several occurrences of the same procedure by different tasks
(orphaning)


* It is sometimes necessary to introduce a synchronization between the
concurrent tasks to avoid, for example, that these modify in any order
the value of the same shared variable (case of reduction operations).

* Generally, tasks are assigned to processors by the operating system.
Different cases can occur:


– at best, at each instant, there is one task per processor with as many
tasks as there are dedicated processors for the duration of the work; +
– at worst, all tasks are processed sequentially by one and only one
processor; +
– in reality, for reasons essentially of operation on a machine whose
processors are not dedicated, the situation is generally intermediate.


* To overcome these problems, it is possible to build the OpenMP runtime
on a library of mixed threads and thus control the scheduling of tasks.

*Construction of a parallel region*

* In a parallel region, by default, the status of variables is shared.
* Within a single parallel region, all concurrent tasks execute the same
code.
* There is an implicit synchronization barrier at the end of the
parallel region.
* “Branching” (eg GOTO, CYCLE, etc.) into or out of a parallel region or
any other OpenMP construct is prohibited.
* It is possible, thanks to the DEFAULT clause, to change the default
status of variables in a parallel region.
* If a variable has a private status (PRIVATE), it is in the stack of
each task. Its value is then undefined at the entry of a parallel region
(in the example opposite, the variable a equals 0 at the entry of the
parallel region)
* However, thanks to the FIRSTPRIVATE clause, it is possible to force
the initialization of this private variable to the last value it had
before entering the parallel region.

*Extent of a parallel region*

* The scope of an OpenMP construct represents the scope of its influence
in the program. +
The influence (or scope) of a parallel region extends both to the code
contained lexically in this region (static scope), and to the code of
the called subroutines. The union of the two represents “dynamic
extent”.
* In a subroutine called in a parallel region, the local and automatic
variables are implicitly private to each of the tasks (they are defined
in the stack of each task).
* In a procedure, all the variables passed by argument (dummy
parameters) by reference, inherit the status defined in the lexical
scope (static) of the region.

*Case of static variables*

* A variable is static if its location in memory is defined at
declaration by the compiler
* Using the THREADPRIVATE directive allows you to privatize a static
instance and make it persistent from one parallel region to another. (
omp_get_thread_num(); )
* If, in addition, the COPYIN clause is specified then the value of
static instances is passed to all tasks.

*Case of dynamic allocation*

* The dynamic memory allocation/deallocation operation can be performed
inside a parallel region.
* If the operation relates to a private variable, it will be local to
each task.
* If the operation concerns a shared variable, then it is more prudent
that only one task (e.g. the master task) takes care of this operation

*Complements*

The construction of a parallel region admits two other clauses:

– REDUCTION: for reduction operations with implicit synchronization
between tasks; +
– NUM_THREADS: it allows to specify the desired number of tasks at the
entrance of a parallel region in the same way as the OMP_SET_NUM_THREADS
subroutine would do.

From one parallel region to another, the number of concurrent tasks can
be varied if desired. To do this, simply use the OMP_SET_DYNAMIC
subroutine or set the OMP_DYNAMIC environment variable to true. It is
possible to nest (nesting) parallel regions, but this only has an effect
if this mode has been activated by calling the OMP_SET_NESTED subroutine
or by setting the OMP_NESTED environment variable.

    *Examples*
    
    #include <omp.h>
    
    int main() 
    { 
    int row;
    
    #pragma omp parallel private(rank) num_threads(3) 
    { 
    rank=omp_get_thread_num(); 
    printf("My rank in region 1: %d \n",rank);
    
    #pragma omp parallel private(rank) num_threads(2) 
    { 
    rank=omp_get_thread_num(); 
    printf(" My rank in region 2: %d \n",rank); 
    }
    
    }
    return 0; 
    }
    
    My rank in region 1: 0 
    My rank in region 2: 1 
    My rank in region 2: 0 
    My rank in region 1: 2 
    My rank in region 2: 1 
    My rank in region 2: 0 
    My rank in region 1: 1 
    My rank in region 2: 0 
    My rank in region 2: 1

*Work sharing*

* In principle, building a parallel region and using a few OpenMP
functions alone is enough to parallelize a piece of code.
* But, in this case, it is up to the programmer to distribute the work
as well as the data and to ensure the synchronization of the tasks.
* Fortunately, OpenMP offers three directives (DO, SECTIONS and
WORKSHARE) which easily allow fairly fine control over the distribution
of work and data as well as synchronization within a parallel region.
* In addition, there are other OpenMP constructs that allow the
exclusion of all but one task to execute a piece of code located in a
parallel region.

*Parallel loop*

* It is a parallelism by distribution of the iterations of a loop.
* The parallelized loop is the one immediately following the DO
directive.
* "Infinite" and do while loops are not parallelizable with OpenMP.
* The mode of distribution of iterations can be specified in the
SCHEDULE clause.
* Choosing the distribution mode provides more control over balancing
the workload between tasks.
* Loop indices are private integer variables.
* By default, a global synchronization is performed at the end of the
END DO construction unless the +
NOWAIT clause has been specified.

*SCHEDULE clause*

* STATIC dispatching consists of dividing the iterations into packets of
a given size (except perhaps for the last one). A set of packets is then
assigned cyclically to each of the tasks, following the order of the
tasks up to the total number of packets. We could have deferred the
choice of the mode of distribution of the iterations using the
OMP_SCHEDULE environment variable. The choice of the distribution mode
of the iterations of a loop can be a major asset for balancing the
workload on a machine whose processors are not dedicated. Caution, for
vector or scalar performance reasons, avoid parallelizing loops
referring to the first dimension of a multi-dimensional array.
* DYNAMIC: iterations are divided into packets of given size. As soon as
a task exhausts its iterations, another packet is assigned to it.
* GUIDED: the iterations are divided into packets whose size decreases
exponentially. All the packets have a size greater than or equal to a
given value except for the last whose size may be less. As soon as a
task completes its iterations, another iteration package is assigned to
it.

*Case of an ordered execution*

* It is sometimes useful (debugging cases) to execute a loop in an
orderly fashion.
* The order of the iterations will then be identical to that
corresponding to a sequential execution.
* A reduction is an associative operation applied to a shared variable.
* The operation can be:
* arithmetic: +, --, *; +
logic: .AND., .OR., .EQV., .NEQV. ; +
an intrinsic function: MAX, MIN, IAND, IOR, IEOR.
* Each task calculates a partial result independently of the others.
They then sync to update the final result.

*Parallel sections*

* A section is a portion of code executed by one and only one task.
* Multiple portions of code can be defined by the user using the SECTION
directive within a SECTIONS construct.
* The goal is to be able to distribute the execution of several
independent portions of code on the different tasks.
* The NOWAIT clause is allowed at the end of the END SECTIONS construct
to remove the implicit synchronization barrier.
* All SECTION directives must appear within the lexical scope of the
SECTIONS construct.
* The clauses allowed in the SECTIONS directive are those we already
know:
* PRIVATE; FIRSTPRIVATE; LASTPRIVATE; REDUCTION.
* The PARALLEL SECTIONS directive is a merger of the PARALLEL and
SECTIONS directives with the union of their respective clauses.

*Exclusive execution*

Sometimes you want to exclude all tasks except one to execute certain
portions of code included in a parallel region.

To do this, OpenMP offers two directives SINGLE and MASTER.

Although the aim is the same, the behavior induced by these two
constructions remains quite different.

Parallel sections

* A section is a portion of code executed by one and only one task.
* Multiple portions of code can be defined by the user using the SECTION
directive within a SECTIONS construct.
* The goal is to be able to distribute the execution of several
independent portions of code on the different tasks.
* The NOWAIT clause is allowed at the end of the END SECTIONS construct
to remove the implicit synchronization barrier.

*Exclusive execution*

* Sometimes you want to exclude all tasks except one to execute certain
portions of code included in a parallel region.
* To do this, OpenMP offers two directives SINGLE and MASTER.
* Although the aim is the same, the behavior induced by these two
constructions remains quite different.

*SINGLE construction*

* The SINGLE construction allows a portion of code to be executed by one
and only one task without being able to specify which one.
* In general, it is the task which arrives first on the SINGLE
construction but it is not specified in the standard.
* All the tasks not executing the SINGLE region wait, at the end of the
END SINGLE construction, for the termination of the one responsible for
it, unless they have specified the NOWAIT clause.

*MASTER building*

* The MASTER construction allows a portion of code to be executed by the
master task alone.
* This construction does not admit any clauses.
* There is no synchronization barrier either at the beginning (MASTER)
or at the end of construction (END MASTER).

*Synchronizations*

Synchronization becomes necessary in the following situations:


{empty}1. to ensure that all concurrent tasks have reached the same
level of instruction in the program (global barrier);

{empty}2. to order the execution of all the concurrent tasks when these
must execute the same portion of code affecting one or more shared
variables whose consistency (in reading or in writing) in memory must be
guaranteed (mutual exclusion).

{empty}3. to synchronize at least two concurrent tasks among the set
(lock mechanism).


As we have already indicated, the absence of a NOWAIT clause means that
a global synchronization barrier is implicitly applied at the end of the
\openmp construction. But it is possible to explicitly impose a global
synchronization barrier thanks to the BARRIER directive.

The mutual exclusion mechanism (one task at a time) is found, for
example, in reduction operations (REDUCTION clause) or in the ordered
execution of a loop (DO ORDERED directive). For the same purpose, this
mechanism is also implemented in the ATOMIC and CRITICAL directives.

Finer synchronizations can be achieved either by setting up lock
mechanisms (this requires calling subroutines from the OpenMP library),
or by using the FLUSH directive.

*Barrier*

* The BARRIER directive synchronizes all concurrent tasks in a parallel
region.
* Each of the tasks waits until all the others have arrived at this
synchronization point to continue the execution of the program together.
* Atomic Update
* The ATOMIC directive ensures that a shared variable is read and
modified in memory by only one task at a time.
* Its effect is local to the statement immediately following the
directive.

*Critical regions*

* A critical region can be seen as a generalization of the ATOMIC
directive although the underlying mechanisms are distinct.
* The tasks execute this region in a non-deterministic order but one at
a time.
* A critical region is defined using the CRITICAL directive and applies
to a portion of code terminated by END CRITICAL.
* Its scope is dynamic.
* For performance reasons, it is not recommended to emulate an atomic
instruction by a critical region.

*FLUSH directive*

* It is useful in a parallel region to refresh the value of a shared
variable in global memory.
* It is all the more useful when the memory of a machine is
hierarchical.
* It can be used to implement a synchronization point mechanism between
tasks.

*Rules of good performance*

* Minimize the number of parallel regions in the code.
* Adapt the number of tasks requested to the size of the problem to be
treated in order to minimize the additional costs of task management by
the system.
* As much as possible, parallelize the outermost loop.
* Use the SCHEDULE(RUNTIME) clause to be able to dynamically change the
scheduling and the size of the iteration packets in a loop.
* The SINGLE directive and the NOWAIT clause can make it possible to
reduce the rendering time at the cost, most often, of an explicit
synchronization.
* The ATOMIC directive and the REDUCTION clause are more restrictive but
more powerful than the CRITICAL directive.
* Use the IF clause to implement conditional parallelization (eg on a
vector architecture, only parallelize a loop if its length is long
enough).
* Inter-task conflicts (of memory bank on a vector machine or of cache
faults on a scalar machine), can significantly degrade performance.

|A Simple Parallel Loop a|
The loop iteration variable is private by default, so it is not
necessary to specify it explicitly in a private clause

    void simple(int n, float *a, float *b)
    {
    int i;
    *#pragma omp parallel for*
    for (i=1; i<n; i++) /* i is private by default */
    b[i] = (a[i] + a[i-1]) / 2.0;
    }
    
_    |The Parallel Construct a|
    The parallel construct can be used in coarse-grain parallel programs._
    
    void subdomain(float *x, int istart, int ipoints)
    {
    int i;
    for (i = 0; i < ipoints; i++)
    x[istart+i] = 123.456;
    }
    
    void sub(float *x, int npoints)
    {
    int iam, nt, ipoints, istart;
    *#pragma omp parallel default(shared) private(iam,nt,ipoints,istart)*
    {
    iam = omp_get_thread_num();
    nt = omp_get_num_threads();
    ipoints = npoints / nt; /* size of partition */
    istart = iam * ipoints; /* starting array index */
    if (iam == nt-1) /* last thread may do more */
    ipoints = npoints - istart;
    subdomain(x, istart, ipoints);
    }
    }
    
    main()
    {
    float array[10000]
    sub(array, 10000)
    return 0;
    }

|Controlling the Number of threads on Multiple Nesting Levels |The
OMP_NUM_THREADS environment variable to control the number of threads on
multiple nesting levels

|Interaction Between the num_threads Clause and omp_set_dynamic a|
The call to the omp_set_dynamic routine with argument 0 in C/C++,
disables the dynamic adjustment of the number of threads in OpenMP
implementations that support it.
    
    #include <omp.h>
    
    int main()
    {
    omp_set_dynamic(0);
    *#pragma omp parallel num_threads(10)*
    {
    /* do work here */
    }
    return 0;
    }

|The nowait Clause a|
If there are multiple independent loops within a parallel region, you can use the nowait clause to avoid the implied barrier at the end of the loop construct
    
    #include <math.h>
    
    void nowait_example(int n, int m, float *a, float *b, float *y, float *z)
    {
    int i;
    *#pragma omp parallel*
    {
    *#pragma omp for nowait*
    for (i=1; i<n; i++)
    b[i] = (a[i] + a[i-1]) / 2.0;
    *#pragma omp for nowait*
    for (i=0; i<m; i++)
    y[i] = sqrt(z[i]);
    }
    }

|The collapse Clause a|
The collapse clause is used since it is implicitly private. The collapse clause associates one or more loops with the directive on which it appears for the purpose of identifying the portion of the depth of the canonical loop nest to which to apply the semantics of the directive. The argument n speciﬁes the number of loops of the associated loop nest to which to apply those semantics. On all directives on which the collapse clause may appear, the eﬀect is as if a value of one was speciﬁed for n if the collapse clause is not speciﬁed.

    void bar(float *a, int i, int j, int k);
    
    int kl, ku, ks, jl, ju, js, il, iu,is;
    
    void sub(float *a)
    {
    int i, j, k;
    *#pragma omp for collapse(2) private(i, k, j)*
    for (k=kl; k<=ku; k+=ks)
    for (j=jl; j<=ju; j+=js)
    for (i=il; i<=iu; i+=is)
    bar(a,i,j,k);
    }

|Linear Clause in Loop Constructs a|
The linear clause in a loop construct to allow the proper
parallelization of a loop that contains an induction variable (_j_). At
the end of the execution of the loop construct, the original variable
_j_ is updated with the value _N/2_ from the last iteration of the loop.

    #include <stdio.h>
    
    #define N 100
    
    int main(void)
    {
    float a[N], b[N/2];
    int i, j;
    for(i = 0;i<N;i++)
    a[i] = i+1;
    j=0
    *#pragma omp parallel*
    *#pragma omp for linear(j:1)*
    for(i=0;i<N;i+=2){
    b[j]= a[i] * 2.0f;
    j++;
    }
    
    printf"%d %f %f\n", j, b[0], b[j-1] );
    /* print out: 50 2.0 198.0 */
    return 0;
    }

|The firstprivate Clause and the sections Construct a|
The firstprivate clause is used to initialize the private copy of
section_count of each thread. The problem is that the section constructs modify section_count, which breaks the independence of the section constructs. When different threads execute each section, both sections will print the value 1. When the same thread executes the two sections, one section will print the value 1 and the other will print the value 2.
Since the order of execution of the two sections in this case is
unspecified, it is unspecified which section prints which value.

    #include <stdio.h>
    
    #define NT 4
    
    int main( ) {
    
    int section_count = 0;
    
    *omp_set_dynamic(0);*
    *omp_set_num_threads(NT);*
    *#pragma omp parallel*
    *#pragma omp sections firstprivate( section_count )*
    {
    
    *#pragma omp section*
    {
    section_count++;
    /* may print the number one or two */
    printf( "section_count %d\n", section_count );
    
    }
    
    *#pragma omp section*
    {
    section_count++;
    /* may print the number one or two */
    printf( "section_count %d\n", section_count );
    }
    
    }
    
    return 0;
    }

|The single Construct a|
Only one thread prints each of the progress messages. All other threads
will skip the single region and stop at the barrier at the end of the
single construct until all threads in the team have reached the barrier.
If other threads can proceed without waiting for the thread executing
the single region, a nowait clause can be specified, as is done in the
third single construct in this example. The user must not make any
assumptions as to which thread will execute a single region.

    #include <stdio.h>
    
    void work1() {}
    
    void work2() {}
    
    void single_example()
    
    
    *#pragma omp parallel*
    {
    *#pragma omp single*
    printf("Beginning work1.\n");
    work1();
    *#pragma omp single*
    printf("Finishing work1.\n");
    *#pragma omp single nowait*
    printf("Finished work1 and beginning work2.\n");
    work2();
    }
    }
    
    
    
    
    |The master Construct a|
    #include <stdio.h>
    
    extern float average(float,float,float);
    void master_example( float* x, float* xold, int n, float tol )
    {
    int c, i, toobig;

    c = 0;

    {
    toobig = 0;
    }

|The omp_set_dynamic and omp_set_num_threads Routines a|
Some programs rely on a fixed, prespecified number of threads to execute
correctly. Because the default setting for the dynamic adjustment of the
number of threads is implementation defined, such programs can choose to
turn off the dynamic threads capability and set the number of threads
explicitly to ensure portability.

    #include <omp.h>
    
    #include <stdlib.h>
    
    void do_by_16(float *x, int iam, int ipoints) {}
