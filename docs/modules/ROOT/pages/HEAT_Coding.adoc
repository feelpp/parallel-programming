* Theory

Heat (or diffusion) equation is a partial differential equation that describes the variation of temperature in a given region over time


\begin{align*}
\frac{\partial u}{\partial t} = \alpha \nabla^2 u
\end{align*}

where *u*(*x*, *y*, *t*) is the temperature field that varies in space and
time, and α is the thermal diffusivity constant.

We limit ourselvels to two dimensions (a plane) where Laplacian can be
discretized in a grid with finite differences as


\begin{align*}
\nabla^2 u  &= \frac{u(i-1,j)-2u(i,j)+u(i+1,j)}{(\Delta x)^2} \\
 &+ \frac{u(i,j-1)-2u(i,j)+u(i,j+1)}{(\Delta y)^2}
\end{align*}

where ∆x and ∆y are the grid spacing of the temperature grid *u*.

Given an initial condition (*u*(t=0) = u0) one can follow the time dependence
of the temperature field with explicit time evolution method:

\begin{align*}
u^{m+1}(i,j) = u^m(i,j) + \Delta t \alpha \nabla^2 u^m(i,j)
\end{align*}


Note: The algorithm is stable only when

\begin{align*}
\Delta t < \frac{1}{2 \alpha} \frac{(\Delta x \Delta y)^2}{(\Delta x)^2 (\Delta y)^2}
\end{align*}

The solver carries out the time development of the 2D heat equation over the number of time steps provided by the user. The default geometry is a flat
rectangle (with grid size provided by the user), but other shapes may be used via input files. The program will produce an image (PNG) of the temperature field after every 100 iterations.
